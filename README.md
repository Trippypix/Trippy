# GitHub Pages Starter

This is a minimal starter for a static site on GitHub Pages.

## How to use
- Keep `index.html` at the root (or in `docs/` if you publish from that folder).
- Commit and push to the selected Pages branch in **Settings → Pages**.
- Optionally add a custom domain via **Settings → Pages → Custom domain**.
